# GigHelper

## Context

I play keyboards in a band. With the end of year shows, the repertoire grew and memorizing the order and timbres of more than 50 songs became unfeasible.

With this in mind, I created GigHelper.

## What is Gig Helper?

In GigHelper you can register up to 127 midis timbres and associate as many songs and chords as you want. When opening the song, the app sends a midi command via USB to the connected devices, changing and configuring the entire keyboard for the selected song.


This project is under development, but can now be tested with the following commands:

```
npm install
```

```
npm run android
```
